Design NLTK responses and converse based chat utility as a function to interact with the user.

# DOMAIN: Customer support

## CONTEXT: 
A company X has a an academic support department which receives numerous support requests every day throughout the
year. Teams are spread across geographies and try to provide support round the year. Sometimes there are circumstances where due to
heavy workload certain request resolutions are delayed, impacting company’s business. Some of the requests are very generic where a
proper resolution procedure delivered to the user can solve the problem. Company is looking forward to design an automation which can
interact with the user, understand the problem and display the resolution procedure if found as a generic request or redirect the request
to an actual human support executive if the request is complex or not in it’s database.
